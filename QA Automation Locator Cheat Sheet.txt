QA Automation Locator Cheat Sheet

1. What is the difference between Relative and Absolute XPath?

	Relative XPath directly identifies the element by attribute (ID, class, name, etc.) without first locating a parent element
		//input[@name='search']

	Absolute XPath traverses through a parent element to find a specific child element
		//div[@class='RNNXgb']/div/div[2]/input


2. How do you traverse to a sibling element from another sibling using XPath?

	Find the relative XPath of the common parent element, then use /following-sibling:: to locate the sibling using the tagName

	//*@id='tablist1-tab1']/following-sibling::li[2]


3. How do you traverse back to a parent element from a child element using XPath?

	Find the relative Xpath of a child element, then use /parent:: to locate the parent using the tagName

	//*@id='tablist1-tab1']/parent::ul


4. How do you identify an element from text?

	Use the regular expression //* to find any tag then use [contains(text(), '')] to locate the text displayed on the page

	//*[contains(text(),'Your text goes here')]"

	Not ideal because text may change in the future
